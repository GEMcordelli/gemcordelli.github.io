      <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Accomplishment 1: Winner of Best Data Story Telling Award for UVA MSDS Capstone on Health Services Utilization</i> - Collaborated with UVA Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) to explore and extract insights from a multi-sourced dataset on CAPS usage rates among students.
Performed cleaning and feature engineering on key variables to open up and streamline future analytical insights for key stakeholders.
Anticipated outcome is to successfully identify, model build and report trends that correlate to both CAPS usage rates, and psychopathological comorbidities.  <a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/news/masters-data-science-students-showcase-real-world-solutions-2025-capstone-presentations">Read more</a></p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3> GSS: The Gender-Pay Gap</h3>
        <p>Dashboard report on the key takeaways from the NORC's annually updated General Social Survey, we take a deep dive into the statistical evidence suggesting the persistent gender-wage pay gap, and display key data visualizations that launch conversations about the social and societal implications of this gap. All this is wrapped into a conveniently surveyable dashboard, which can be accessed using Dash and the .py file located in the Dashboard repo linked here.
